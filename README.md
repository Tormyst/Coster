# Coster
This is a coster for the graphics class I recently took.

Space - toggle mode

 + - zoom in in rotate mode

- - zoom out in rotate mode

arrow keys - Left and right will allow for more specific rotation.  Down will return to normal rotation.

r - A refresh of the coster from the file.


This coster is build from a file.  You may try and edit the file yourself.  The format for the file is:

<Number of points>

<Point 1 X> <Point 1 Y> <Point 1 Z>

<Point 2 X> <Point 2 Y> <Point 2 Z>

...

...


As an argument into the program, you may indicate a file to read from, otherwise the file "wildbeast.rc" will be read from.


Features included:  Fully realized roler coster, complete with tilt and a moving camera along it in cart mode.


Features rotation mode to slowly more around the track.  Controls for a more controlled experience within rotation mode.


Featuring a hellscape, high contrast track, And all the no lighting or texture mapping that you come to expect. 


Featuring the cubes as decorations to make the track look better.  Featuring something that looks like physics based speed.
